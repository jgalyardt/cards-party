# Cards Party

This is an open source implementation of Cards Against Humanity utilizing Firebase, with the twist that all cards are write ins. I created this project to learn Firebase- future steps would be to rework the front-end, as right now it's just jQuery. Supports Google sign-in and uses a persistent chat-log.
